      <b>Lesson 1: HTML</b>
      <p><b>HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language, which adds <em>markup instructions</em> (font, spacing, etc) to the basic text or other content to structure it into a legible webpage.

      <b>Using HTML</b>
      <p>Tags and text form elements, which are the subcomponents of an HTML file. Tags can be inline, which means they print like a typewriter, or block, meaning they create a field or box with whitespace. They usually open and close around a subject, but in some cases (eg. line break) are 'void' and can stand alone.</p>
      <p>Computers are stupid, meaning programmers must eliminate ambiguity.</p>

    <h2> <b>Stage 1 Notes</b></h2>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>HTML design uses a tree-like structure; building pages in this way makes it easier to keep code organized and also helps with element formatting.
        </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <p>Breaking the page into discrete elements - <em>using dir tags for example</em> - creates rectangular boxes around blocks of content. Not all these are visible immediately when inspecting them, but by clicking right-arrows you can see everything down to text level.</p>
        <p>Designing pages is therefore an exercise of identifying boxes of discrete content, organizing them informally and then working on style and detail. 'Start big and work down to small'.<p>
